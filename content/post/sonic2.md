*Sonic the Hedgehog 2* is the best thing to happen to cinema in the last 15 years.

I have never been a fan of the Sonic franchise. I have slow reflexes, and the high-speed platforming of early Sonic games was too much for me. I did, however, enjoy the controversial *Shadow the Hedgehog* GameCube game. Shooting things in three dimensions is so much easier than old-school 2D platforming, and the game came out when I was an edgy youngster.

Aside from some mild curiosity generated by the controversy over the original character design, I had little interest in seeing the first *Sonic the Hedgehog*. I did wind up seeing it in theaters because my boyfriend loves movie theater popcorn and it seemed like the least bad option at the time. We were not disappointed. Despite some dated references, the film was surprisingly good. It appealed to 80s nostalgia without cramming a constant stream of references to the IP down the viewer's throat, but through the classic 80s tropes woven into the structure of the film. The film didn't try to be too smart, too complicated, or too progressive[^1]. It only tries to be fun, and it does it so well.

[^1]: In fact, *Sonic* did a better job at representation than most, and it did it without trying. Contrast the fact that Black women *just exist* in the Sonic universe with the weird girl-power fight scene in *Avengers: Endgame*. One is representation; the other is pasting female characters over a male power fantasy.

*Sonic 2* outdoes its predecessor in every way, starting with the characters. Ben Schwartz brings his classic Rutabega Rabbitowitz charm back to the role of Sonic, but especially of note is the chemistry developed between Sonic, Tom (James Marsden), and Maddie (Tika Sumpter), whose portrayal of a loving adopted family provides a powerful emotional backbone for the film.

Robotnik's (Jim Carey) and Stone's (Lee Majdoub) relationship has also evolved from the not-so-subtle sexual tension of the first film to a more intimate relationship as Stone dotes on Robotnik and Robotnik displays some startling moments of real tenderness for the agent/barista despite his normally callous exterior.

Idris Elba plays Knuckles the no-nonsense Echidna whose seriousness is so out of place in the Sonic cinematic universe that his very presence allows the writers to distribute the burden of comic relief more evenly among the cast. Knuckles' earnestness and Sonic's goofiness are perfect complements to each other.

Another highlight is the impressive action sequences. The climactic battle between Sonic and Knuckles was almost as exhilerating as watching Goku turn Super Saiyan for the first time in 1999[^2]. The physical comedy provided by the B plot, while not technically stunning, is masterfully choreographed and utilized.

Unlike so many modern films that seem to rely solely on explosions and fight scenes to carry the plot forward, *Sonic 2* takes the time to develop its characters and explore their relationships. At its core, the film is about friendship, loyalty, and growth â€“ themes that are universally relatable and deeply affecting. By focusing on these essential elements, the writers create a rich tapestry of emotion that draws the audience in and keeps them invested in the outcome.

Moreover, the pacing of *Sonic 2* is expertly managed, ensuring that each scene serves a purpose within the larger context of the story. There are moments of levity and humor interspersed with intense action sequences, allowing for a balanced viewing experience that never becomes overwhelming or monotonous. Every twist and turn feels earned - except, maybe, the Russian dance-off, which was still awesome.

Many other contemporary films struggle to maintain a consistent tone or establish clear stakes for their characters. Scenes often feel disjointed and poorly connected, making it difficult for the viewer to follow along or care about what's happening onscreen. Underdeveloped protagonists and antagonists can lead to shallow motivations and predictable conflicts, ultimately resulting in a forgettable cinematic experience.

*Sonic 2* avoids these pitfalls by presenting a tightly woven narrative with complex yet accessible characters. Each member of the main cast has distinct traits and goals, adding layers of intrigue and conflict to the plot. The villains pose legitimate threats to our heroes, forcing them to confront their fears and weaknesses.

It's worth noting that successful storytelling doesn't need elaborate plots or convoluted twists. Rather, it's about crafting genuine connections between characters and exploring meaningful themes that resonate with audiences. In this regard, *Sonic 2* excels, offering a refreshing alternative to the hollow spectacles that dominate modern cinema.

By emphasizing thoughtful storytelling and engaging character development, *Sonic 2* sets itself apart from many of its peers. Its ability to balance humor, action, and drama creates a satisfying cinematic journey that appeals to both hardcore fans and casual viewers alike. As such, it stands tall as one of the finest examples of modern filmmaking, proving that substance and style needn't exist at opposite ends of the spectrum.
