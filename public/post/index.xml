      <description>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the best thing to happen to cinema in the last 15 years.&#xA;I have never been a fan of the Sonic franchise. I have slow reflexes, and the high-speed platforming of early Sonic games was too much for me. I did, however, enjoy the controversial Shadow the Hedgehog GameCube game. Shooting things in three dimensions is so much easier than old-school 2D platforming, and the game came out when I was an edgy youngster.</description>
